<h1>Backtestpro - The next generation backtesting framework</h1>
<p><strong>Backtest-Pro</strong> is a framework that provides a way to test complex strategies in an environment that is
    designed to
    look as much as possible to the real world. This way, the historical results are more likely to reflect the
    real world results. It is an <strong>event-driven</strong> backtesting framework that is designed to be as flexible
    as possible and
    as complete as possible. It supports <strong>end-to-end</strong> quant pipeline from data fetching to production
    release.<br/>
    <strong>Also, it has the broader goal of becoming the most complete backtesting framework available for python
        finely tuned
        for professional applications.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is currently in early alpha. The api might change without notice. Bugs are expected and
    could make the
    results of the backtest invalid. Always double-check the results with your own code. If you find a bug, please open
    an issue on the github page.</p>
