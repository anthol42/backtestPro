    "## Strategy\n",
    "In this section, you will see how to create a strategy that fits your need.  You will see how to interact with the bank account, the broker and the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Derive the class\n",
    "The first step is to derive a class from the ```Strategy``` class.  The only required method to implement is the ```run``` method.  This is where the logic of the strategy is implemented.  It can be simple if-else clauses, it can be some decision trees or complex machine learning algorithms.  You can also override the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method to add some dynamic attributes to your class.  You can add any method you want and attributes you want with two exceptions: ```init``` and ```__call__```.  You should not override those methods.  Notice that it is written ```init``` not ```__init__```.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a strategy is release using the serve module its state needs to be saved to disk.  To do so, there is a default save and load method implemented that store the state as a pickle file.  If you want to store the state in another format, you can override those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Interaction\n",
    "The run method is called at every step and passes the current data to the strategy via the data parameter.  This parameter contains a ```RecordsBucket``` object.  This object contains few attributes defined below.  This object contains all the records(charts) of all assets across all time resolutions (if multiple were used).  To access a given time resolution, you can use the ```[]``` operator with the desired ```timedelta``` object or its index in the ```available_time_res``` attribute.  This will return a ```Records``` object.  The ```main``` attribute is an alias to access the ```Records``` object associated with the main time resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Records``` is sort of a set of individual ```Record``` for a single time resolution.  Each record contains the price chart of the asset and all the added features, but also some other information such as the rate of dividends (quarterly, annually, etc).  The data is kind of structured as a tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "RecordsBucket\n",
    "├ Records\n",
    "┊ ┕ Record\n",
    "┊ ┊  ┕ pd.DataFrame (The chart)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interactions with the Account\n",
    "It can be useful to know how much available cash remains in the account to calculate how much money to invest in a trade.  To do so, you can interact with the account that is referenced as the ```account``` attribute of the Strategy.  It is directly connected to the backtest engine.  It is strongly recommonded to not modify the state of the account for example depositing money or adding collateral, even though nothing blocks you from modifying doing because it could cause bugs and give wrong backtest results.  What you can do with the account is access the ```available_cash``` property, the ```collateral``` property or the ```transactions``` property, but make sure you do not modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Interactions with the portfolio\n",
    "It can be useful to know what positions are currently open to perform actions.  To do so, yoi can access the ```porfolio``` attribute of the Strategy.  Again, you must not modify its state.  You can access the ```long``` or the ```short``` attributes to access the open positions.  Again, make sure to not modify anything.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interaction with the broker\n",
    "Your strategy will interact with the broker to open/close positions.  You can use these methods:\n",
    "- ```buy_long```: to open a long position\n",
    "- ```sell_long```: to close a long position\n",
    "-  ```sell_short```: to open a short position\n",
    "-  ```buy_short```: to close a short position.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must not change the state of the broker other than from these methods, again to avoid bugs and false results.  If you want to know what are the pending transactions, you can access the the ```pending_orders``` property of the broker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the following example, we will implement a Strategy that buys a security when the daily 7 day simple moving average start increasing and the candle is over the weekly 50 days simple moving average.  It sells if the 7 day moving average start decreasing.  It will invest one third of the available cash in any trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features used in the example:**  \n",
    "- Data interactions with multiple time resolutions\n",
    "- Interaction with the account to know how much cash is available\n",
    "- Interaction with the portfolio to know if a given position is open\n",
    "- Interaction with the broker to trade."

    "## Backtest\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to configure a backtest object to fit your specific needs.  We will use the above strategy and test it on a 10y backtest from 2010 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple parameters that can be set to customize the way the backtest will work.  For example, we can Add technical indicators (or more generally time-series generated from the data) - ```indicators``` parameter - that are computed on the fly on the window shown to the strategy.  Calculating the indicators that way takes more time (more compute intensive), but the results should be closer to reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter that can be set is the ```TimeResExtender```.  This is an object that will extend the time resolution to other.  For example, if the only time resolution fetch by the data pipeline is 1h, we could setup a TimeResExtender object to make new available time resolution such as daily or weekly.  These will be available like any other time resolution fetch from a data pipeline from the ```RecordsBucket``` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tune the ```window``` size: the number of days in the past the strategy can see.\n",

    "Also, you can change the initial cash by providing a number to the ```initial_cash``` parameter.\n"
